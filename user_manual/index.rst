**Welcome to  Webwork**

Webwork is open source file sync and share software for everyone from
individuals operating the free Webwork Server in the privacy of their own
home, to large enterprises and service providers supported by the Webwork
Enterprise Subscription. Webwork provides a safe, secure, and compliant
file synchronization and sharing solution on servers that you control.

You can share one or more files and folders on your computer, and synchronize
them with your Webwork server. Place files in your local shared directories,
and those files are immediately synchronized to the server and to other devices
using the Webwork Desktop Sync Client, Android app, or iOS app. To
learn more about the Nextcloud desktop client, please refer to:
